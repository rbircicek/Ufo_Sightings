# Summary
Due to the size of the data we are limited in seeing the pattern of these sightings if there is any. With the larger data and and a more detailed search criteria, we could figure out such pattern. For the improvement of the project, I would love to add pictures for each sighting with the web scraping. At the bottom of the webpage, we could also give links of similar sites as a resource for the visitors who would like to learn more about Ufo sightings.
